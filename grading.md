Grading and Policies
====================

Grading
-------

Grading will be based on class participation, assignments, and a final
project. <!-- The assignments are worth 30% of the final grade, midterm -->
<!-- exam is worth 30% of the final grade, final project is worth 35% of -->
<!-- the final grade, and class participation is worth 5% of the final -->
<!-- grade. -->

Homeworks
---------

 * There will be a problem set about every week.
 <!-- * Unless stated otherwise, all homeworks must be either typed, -->
 <!--   preferably in LaTeX, or legible if it's paper copy. -->
 * All homeworks are due at the beginning of class.
 * Late submission policy :
    - **Upto 24 hours** : penalty of 10%
    - **24--48 hours** : penalty of 25%
    - **Beyond 48 hours** : solutions will be released and no more submissions
     are accepted.
 * In case of a health-related emergency or other personal issues when
 you cannot submit homeworks on time, feel free to talk to us and we
 will work something out.

Collaborating and Cheating
--------------------------
 * There is a difference between collaborating and cheating to do your
   homeworks.
 * Working with others on the assignments does not mean dividing the
   problems among you, and then swapping answers.
 * You are welcome to confer with other students and use information
 available on the internet for your homeworks, as long as the sources
 are properly cited. Do not copy the sentences/paragraphs word-to-word
 from the sources. You must show us that you understand the problem
 and solution.
 * Solutions must be prepared individually.
 * A similarity between solutions of two students beyond a reasonable
doubt will earn both students a zero. A disciplinary action may also
be taken against such students.
