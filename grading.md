Grading and Policies
====================

This is a graduate-level seminar. If you are taking it for credit, you
are expected to keep up with the lectures, work though the exercises
in the tutorial, and experiment with Lean on your own. You will also
need to complete a final project, which will ideally consist of a
formalization in Lean. Please consult with the instructors while
choosing a topic.
